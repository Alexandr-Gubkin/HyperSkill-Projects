Description
Now, improve your search engine to support complex queries containing a sequence of words and a strategy that determines how to match data.

There are six sample lines:

Dwight Joseph djo@gmail.com
Rene Webb webb@gmail.com
Katie Jacobs
Erick Harrington harrington@gmail.com
Myrtle Medina
Erick Burgess
Let's consider the searching strategies: ALL, ANY and NONE.

If the strategy is ALL, the program should print lines containing all words from the query.
Query:

Harrington Erick
Result:

Erick Harrington harrington@gmail.com
If the strategy is ANY, the program should print lines containing at least one word from the query.
Query:

Erick Dwight webb@gmail.com
Result:

Erick Harrington harrington@gmail.com
Erick Burgess
Dwight Joseph djo@gmail.com
Rene Webb webb@gmail.com
If the strategy is NONE, the program should print lines that do not contain words from the query at all:
Query:

djo@gmail.com ERICK
Result:

Katie Jacobs
Myrtle Medina
Rene Webb webb@gmail.com

All listed operations are implemented in the inverted index. The results should not contain duplicates.
Note, do not forget to use methods to decompose your program.

Example
The lines that start with > represent the user input.

=== Menu ===
1. Find a person
2. Print all persons
0. Exit
> 1

Select a matching strategy: ALL, ANY, NONE
> ANY

Enter a name or email to search all suitable people.
